# Contribution guidelines

* Practice common sense and observe applicable [Awesome List Guidelines](https://github.com/sindresorhus/awesome/blob/master/contributing.md).
* Proof-read yourself.
* Please be nice.
* Be brave with contributing and commenting.
* Consider if the item you're adding to the list is actually pretty useful and/or exciting for the Terraform community or newcomers.
* In case we gather a lot of links that are kinda-useful, but not exactly awesome, we could create another list within the repo.
